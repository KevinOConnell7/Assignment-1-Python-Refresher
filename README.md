This image is my code for the echo.py assignment. In my code I created a loop so that it prints the correct characters of the echo in it. I created a result variable that takes away one of the last 3 letters every time it loops through the code. I then added a /n so it creates a new line everytime.

Here is the output of my echo.py code


## Python Decorator Implementation
fib.py

This is the code I used to calculate the fibonacci number. In this code I used recursion and I looped in the __main__ to send each number from 0-100 through the fibo code.

This displays the output that I had when running this code.

Here is a chart I made with the time it took to calculate each of the Fibonacci numbers and the number it calculated it for all the way up too 100. This plot aswell shows that lower numbers are quicker to compute since we used reccursion and the larger numbers take much more time.
